# Scientific_computing_with_python

In this repository I have included the 5 course projetcs related with the class ''Scientific Computing with python-Python for Everybody'. 

The project description is given below:

**1) Arithmetic Formattter:**
The goal was to create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

**2) Time Calculator:**
The project demanded to write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter that takes:

a) a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)

b) a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes

c) (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive

The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

**3) A budget app:**
A class-related tasks which should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment.

**4) Polygon Area Calculator:**
In this project the goal was to use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class was a subclass of Rectangle and inherit its methods and attributes.

**5) Probability calculator:**
In this challenge the goal was to write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.
